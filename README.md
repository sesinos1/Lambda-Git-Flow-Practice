# Lambda-Git-Flow-Practice

1. Create **YOUR OWN** version of Repo ---> (Fork)

2. Add your PM as collaborator

   **on GitHub:**  
   _`Settings`_ -> _`Collaborators`_ -> _`Add Collaborator` (use your PM's handle)_</br>
   _(I'd suggest grabbing the invite tag and DM it to your PM on Slack at this point)_

3. Clone **YOUR** Repo

   **back on your machine:**  
   `git clone <your-repo-address>`

4. Create a branch (the one you are going to be working on)

   `cd <repo directory>`</br>
   `git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'`

5)  Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch

    `git push -u origin firstname-lastname`

    **on GitHub:**  
    `Compare & Pull Request` -> `Base: YOUR MASTER` (Not the Lambda Master)  
     compare fork: **`YOUR FORK`**

6.  Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull Request
    
    On the _'`Open a Pull Request`'_ page click on _`Reviewers`_. If your PM has accepted your invite, then you should be able to select them here. If not, then they haven't accepted the invite, and come back later...

    **Your PM** will merge the work into **YOUR** Master fork when they have reviewed and approved it.

    Thank you for making this, it should be part of the class.(very helpful :)
